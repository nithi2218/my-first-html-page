    <h1>Thai Red Curry with Vegetables</h1>   
<p>This Thai red curry made a fantastic meal last night and perhaps an even better breakfast this morning. It’s warm, comforting, and perfect for cool days. It’s a little rich, too, but so full of vegetables that it doesn’t feel too indulgent.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>1 ¼ cups brown jasmine rice or long-grain brown rice, rinsed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small white onion</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger, 2 gloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced into thin 2-inch long strips</li>
    <li>1 yellow, orange bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk**</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups packed thinly sliced kale</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar or fresh lime juice</li></ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To cook the rice, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling for 30 minutes. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to pot. Just before serving</li>
<li>To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the oil. Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously.</li>
<li>Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are fork-tender, 3 to 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the curry paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the coconut milk, water, kale and sugar, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peppers, carrots and kale have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>Remove the pot from the heat and season with tamari and rice vinegar. Add salt (I added ¼ teaspoon for optimal flavor), to taste. If the curry needs a little more punch, add ½ teaspoon more tamari, or for more acidity, add ½ teaspoon more rice vinegar. Divide rice and curry into bowls and garnish with chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, if you’d like. If you love spicy curries, serve with sriracha or chili garlic sauce on the side.</li></ol>
